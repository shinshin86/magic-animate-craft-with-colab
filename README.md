# MagicAnimateCraft with Colab

This project involves utilizing vid2densepose to create custom motion videos based on personal preferences.  
Following the creation of these motion videos, the flow transitions to using MagicAnimate for video production.  
The entire process is facilitated through a Colab environment.
